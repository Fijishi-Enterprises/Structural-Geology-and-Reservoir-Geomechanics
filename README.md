# fractoolbox

Python tools for structural geology, borehole image analysis, and reservoir geomechanics.  


The _Demo_ directory contains step-by-step walkthroughs of fractoolbox and other related libraries (such as mplstereonet). Some also describe the theory underlying the tools and point readers to relevant academic literature. If you are new to fractoolbox, these are a good place to start.

The _CaseStudy_ directory contains notebooks and a conference paper that describes fractoolbox methods applied to data from geothermal wells in Indonesia and New Zealand.

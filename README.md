# fractoolbox
Python tools for structural geology and borehole image analysis which includes data handling, frequency and geometric analysis, and reservoir geomechanics.  

fractoolbox is in rapid development so the content of this repo will change regularly and may not be stable. We welcome use of the fractoolbox libraries and notebooks but only on an 'as is' basis and without any warranty implied. 

The juypter notebooks are step-by-step walkthroughs of fractoolbox and other related libraries (such as mplstereonet). Some also include the theory underlying the tools. If you are new to fractoolbox, these are a good place to start. 

Compatible with Python 3.3+

### New to python? Start here.

If you are new to python, A introductory Python course for geoscientists can be found [here](https://github.com/ddempsey/python_for_geoscientists) which includes a useful quick-start guide. 

We recommend starting by downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage python and Juypter notebook installation because it comes with many of packages fractoolbox requires.  

The mplstereonet library is used in fractoolbox for geometric analysis and will need to be installed separately after you have installed Anaconda. Refer to https://github.com/joferkington/mplstereonet for installation instructions.

Using the green 'Code' button on this page, download and unzip a copy of this repository and have fun exploring your own fracture data.

### Development

To date, the content of fractoolbox has been generated during doctoral research undertaken by Irene Wallis and supervised by David Dempsey and Julie Rowland. The paper below illustrates use of these tools to interpret borehole image data acquired in high-temperature geothermal wells.

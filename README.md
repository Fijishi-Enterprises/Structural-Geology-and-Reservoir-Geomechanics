# fractoolbox
Python tools for structural geology and borehole image analysis which includes data handling, frequency and geometric analysis, and reservoir geomechanics.  

fractoolbox is in rapid development so the content of this repo will change regularly and may not be stable. We welcome use of the fractoolbox libraries and notebooks but only on an 'as is' basis and without any warranty implied. 

The juypter notebooks are step-by-step walkthroughs of fractoolbox and other related libraries (such as mplstereonet). Some also include the theory underlying the tools. If you are new to fractoolbox, these are a good place to start. 

Compatible with Python 3.3+

### New to python? Start here.

If you are new to python, you can read more about what juypter notebooks are [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and we recommend using [Annaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to install the package and run them. Pandas, numpy and matplotlib comes standard with the data science version of Anaconda but you will need to install the mplstereonet library separately. Refer to https://github.com/joferkington/mplstereonet for mplstereonet installation instructions.

### Development

To date, the content of fractoolbox has been generated during doctoral research undertaken by Irene Wallis and supervised by David Dempsey and Julie Rowland. The paper below illustrates use of these tools to interpret borehole image data acquired in high-temperature geothermal wells.

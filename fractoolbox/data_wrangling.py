'''
Tools to convert between the various ways fracture geometry are described

Structural Data Format Examples 
-------------------------------
The following examples all using the same fracture plane

    Borehole image log analysis:
    -   dip magnitude and dip azimuth
        Format example: dip = 30, dipaz = 350

    Structural geology:
    -   strike (0-360 degrees) and dip (0-90 degrees), using the right-hand rule
        Format example: 260/30

    -   strike (0-180 degrees), dip (0-90 degrees), and dip direction (East or West)
        Format example: 80/30/W

Refer to stereonet-basics.ipynb for visual examples, 
including how to describe and plot a line or rake

The Right-Hand Rule
-------------------
Place your right hand on the fracture plane with fingers pointed down
the direction of dip. Your thumb points to the strike azimuth which is
used under the right-hand rule convention.

def xyzinterp(mDdat, mDsur, xsur, ysur, zsur):
    """Interpolates xyz for a point on the well path
    
    Interpolation finds an xyz point on a line defined by an existing xy and measured depth
    z can be depth or any other float attribute (e.g., resistivity)
    Measured depth is the common value between the interpolation point and the line 
    Method was designed for adding xyz to a Pandas dataframe of fractures

    Args:
        xyzinterp expects input objects to be columns from a Pandas dataframe
        Ensure all depth data has the same datum (typically rig floor for well data)

        mDdat (float): Meters measured depth along the well path of the data point
        mDsur (float): Meters measured depth along the line (well path from a directional survey file)
        xsur (float): Easting location from the survey file in whatever co-ordinate system 
        ysur (float): Northing location from the survey file in whatever co-ordinate system
        zsur (float): Total vertical depth (or other data such as well plunge or azimuth) 
            assocated at the location defined by xsur and ysur. Will not work with z = elevation data, 
            so use 'datum - vertical depth' to find elevation of the point

    Returns:
        A dataframe with the mD (float), x (float), y (float), and z (float) at the point defined by mDdat
    
    Usage example:

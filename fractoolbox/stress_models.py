    '''Magnitude of overburden stress [Sv in MPa] at a given observation depth

    Simple intergration model using single density that returns a
    vertical stress vaule for the observation depth which is passed in.

    Args:
        maxdepth: the maximum depth of the stress model [m]
        obsdepth = depth(s) where Sv will be returned [m]
        obsdepth can be a single value, a list or a Pandas dataframe coloumn
        density = average rock density [kg/m3] which is typically 2200 - 2800

    Returns:
        Sv_obsdepth: Vertical stress aka overburden [MPa]
